# Password Strength Checker (PowerShell)

This is a simple but effective script that evaluates the strength of a password based on common security guidelines. 
It's built in PowerShell and runs in a loop, allowing repeated checks until the user exits.

## Features

- Validates password strength based on five rules:
  - Minimum length (8 characters)
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Outputs a score from 0 to 5
- Gives a strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong)
- Runs in a loop for continuous testing
- Clean, readable console output

## How to Use

1. Open PowerShell
2. Navigate to the script location
    ```
    cd path\to\script
    ```
4. Run the script
    ```
    .\PasswordStrengthChecker.ps1
    ```
6. Enter a password when prompted.
7. View the individual check results and overall strength score.
8. Type exit when youâ€™re done.

## Example Output

Enter password to check or type 'exit' to quit  
Input: MyPass123!

Length check passed  
Uppercase letter check passed  
Lowercase letter check passed  
Number check passed  
Special character check passed  

Password score: 5 out of 5
